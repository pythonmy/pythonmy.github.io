        <h1>What is <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.</p>
        <p>Python runs on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/source/" target="_blank">Linux/Unix</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a>, and has been ported to the <a href="http://www.jython.org/" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="http://ironpython.net/" target="_blank">.NET</a> virtual machines.</p>
        <p>Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.</p>
        <p class="text-danger">New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3" target="_blank">Read Python 2 or Python 3</a>.</p>
        <p>The Python Software Foundation holds the intellectual property rights behind Python, underwrites the PyCon conference, and funds other projects in the Python community.</p>

        <h3>Some History on Python .....</h3>
        <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum back in the late 1980s. He was quoted to have said .....</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="text-success">
            "Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>..... and thus that was how it all began.</p>
        <p><mark>Van Rossum is still actively developing Python, notably during his work with Google from 2005-2012. Since 2013, he has joined Dropbox.</mark></p>
